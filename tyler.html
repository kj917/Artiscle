            <h3>Key Tracks & Collaborations</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>“Ring Ring Ring” - Sample-heavy lead single, blending R&B and hip-hop; samples Ray Parker Jr. & Raydio; charted at #44 on the Billboard Hot 100..</li>
              <li>Big Poe - Features Pharrell Williams and introduces the album with a playful, aggressive energy and altered persona.</li>
              <li>Sugar on My Tongue - Electro-infused, disco-funk track released as a single on August 19; peaked at #41 on Billboard.</li>

            <h3>A Shift Toward Pure Groove</h3>
            <p>
            Unlike his introspective and concept-driven previous release, Chromakopia (2024), this project leans heavily into dance explosion—electro, synth-funk, disco, Miami bass, and house—embracing sound and energy over deep narrative. Tyler flips the script, inviting listeners to forget introspection and just move: “body movement / no sitting still.”            </p>
